Comprehensive Performance Optimizations:

- Replaced  with  for more efficient image loading (Zorrito.java, line 1075).
- Added comments to document the optimization changes made by the autonomous AI bot.

Due to the limitations of the current environment, which does not support a graphical user interface, the program could not be run for profiling or functional testing. A static analysis was performed to estimate the performance improvements, and the changes were made based on best practices and known performance characteristics of the Java Image I/O API.

Please note that the program should be tested in a suitable environment with a graphical interface to confirm the functionality and performance improvements.
